# Warning Classification
Static code analyzer raises all kinds of errors and warnings after inspecting a given codebase. Some of them tend to be false positives (and negatives). Our objective was to discern False from the True by leveraging machine learning models. We experimented with several models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, LightGBM, XGBoost and several others. For now, I have only uploaded my contributions. We trained the models on features extracted from Java sourcecode.
